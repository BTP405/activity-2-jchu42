1. Approach 1:
    This approach creates a list of values from 0 to 4, which its values being doubled those values (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). It then goes through this list and prints it. 
   Approach 2:
    This approach does the same thing, but it is far more obvious what it does, and doesn't require an extra function. 
   Approach 3:
    This approach uses a generator in the function for the for loop. I assume that after each yield is returned, the doubleG function is paused until it is called again for the next value. 
2. doubleG is a generator function. Instead of creating an array and then storing it in memory, it can just return one value at a time. This means the array of values doesn't have to be stored in memory, and that the function can get started before the whole list is generated - it gets generated as it loops.
